Welcome to Monster Corporation!

### Core Values
1. **Scare the Status Quo**: We challenge everyday norms with daring ideas that might send a chill down the spine.
2. **Fearless Innovation**: If it doesn’t raise the hairs on your neck, we haven’t gone far enough.
3. **Nightly Collaboration**: Our best brainstorms happen at midnight. We recommend bringing coffee—and a flashlight.

### Dress Code
- Monday through Thursday: Smart-casual monster attire. (Fangs, horns, or tentacles optional.)
- Friday: Full cosplay recommended. Remember, HR has declared that “Zombie Casual” is a valid uniform choice.

### Communication Guidelines
- Slack channels must use spooky emojis whenever possible.
  Example: :ghost: for new ideas, :skull: for production issues, and :vampire: for urgent tasks.
- If you discover a bug, file it under the “Boo-g Reports” channel immediately.
  Include the phrase “OoOoOps” at the start of your message for escalation.

### Work Hours
- Official hours are from dusk until dawn, although flexible scheduling is allowed for creatures of the day.
- All-hands meetings take place during the Witching Hour on Wednesdays.
  Attendance is mandatory unless you’re a werewolf working from home.

### Performance Reviews
- Employees who consistently exhibit monstrous creativity earn the coveted “Frightfully Good” rating.
- Those failing to scare their peers at least once a quarter may be sentenced to “The Dungeon,”
  a playful 10-minute DevOps fiasco in which you must fix an intentionally corrupted CI pipeline.

Thank you for joining Monster Corporation, where each day is a hair-raising adventure!
