### MONSTER CORPORATION UNLEASHES “FRANKENBOT”

Aurora City – Today, Monster Corporation officially launched FrankenBot,
a groundbreaking AI chatbot that’s stitched together from the “best parts” of legacy AI modules.

#### Key Features
- **Adaptive Personalities**: FrankenBot can adopt multiple tones (professional, comedic, or monstrous)
  based on the user’s preference—just watch out for the occasional bolt of static discharge.
- **Shockingly Quick Responses**: Leveraging Monster Corp’s Ghoul-Driven Development (GDD),
  FrankenBot can handle thousands of queries before needing a midnight recharge.
- **Harvested Knowledge**: FrankenBot integrates with our Monster Vault,
  rumored to contain data from centuries of cryptic experimentation.

#### Early Praise
- *“A bold leap into the weird and wonderful,”* says The Spectral Times.
- *“I asked FrankenBot for a cookie recipe and got a lightning-infused recommendation.
  Best cookies ever!”* – Beta Tester #13

“This is just the beginning,” said Count Fang, Founder & CEO of Monster Corporation.
“We’re pushing the boundaries of AI innovation—and possibly reality—as we know it.”
